# Modinfo

Modinfo.json is an approach to standardize mod metadata like version, incompabilities and dependencies, descriptions, creators etc.

The [integrated modloader](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno1800-mod-loader#readme) uses some information since GU17.

[Sample Modinfo.json](./modinfo.json)

To include a modinfo.json in your mod, simply put it in the mods' root directory.
